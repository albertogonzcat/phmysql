y php class to connect and do basic MySQL statements, and not being redeveloping
all that stuff from zero everytime I need to develop some website and/or script.

-----= Usage:

$phmysql = new phmysql;
$phmysql->setConnection("localhost", "root", "pass", "phmysql");
$clients_number = $phmysql->getNumRows("SELECT * FROM clients");
$new_clients = $phmysql->getArray("SELECT * FROM clients WHERE not_checked = 1");
$phmysql->showDebug(false, true);

-----= Log example:

--- phmysql: Debug log Start ---
